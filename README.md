## CREDITS

### Content
As my knowledge of implementation is limited at this point in my learning, the initial set up & style was set loosely on the 'Love Running' & 'Coffee Shop' walk-through project. From there, I took inspiration for the design of the navigation bar, along with the display of the social links in the footer element.

The styling of the form element in 'Love Running' & 'Coffee Shop' was used as a starting point for my form to help remember all categories that needed to be addressed.

-I took some style referance from 'w3schools' online free source for Navigation bar and footer backgroung color.
[Referance](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav_responsive.asp)

-For [Image side by side](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav_responsive.asp) also referance taken from 'w3schools' for the landing page 

Some support was provided by my fellow student through our 'SLACK community'. They were also immeasurably helpful in explaining positioning containers in a way that I was able to grasp. I also got suggestion for device layout & how to write me readme file in Gitpod
